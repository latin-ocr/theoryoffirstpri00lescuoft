csse from amn-csse, no created being. inasrnuch as it is not the cause οἱ its
own essc, can exercize this exclusively divine function. Neither is the activity
οἱ the First Principle limited to only one effect. since creation is not generation.
but is rather the result οἱ 3 free act οἱ the will on the part of the First Principle.

L'lrich basis his critique of the Aristotelian Eighth Book of the Physics and
its arguments for the eternity oi time. motion, and the world on Albert's com—
mentary on this same work. which itself stems from the Gnide For the Per-
plcxcd οἱ Moses Maimonides. After presenting his refutation of the various
peripatetic arguments. L'lrich next proceeds to state and refute with equal vigor
the favorite ''demonstrations'' for the creation οἱ the world in time. His con-
tention is that neither set oi arguments. ie„ neither for nor against the eternity
of time. motion, and the world is conclusive. At best. they are only quasi-
demonstrations which have a limited persuasive force. In this respect. Ulrich
seems to be in complete accord with the position of St. Thomas Aquinas, who
likewise believed that the creation of the world in time could not be proved
conclusively by reason alone,

The one incongruous note in Ulrich's whole position is his apparent espousal
οἱ the Averroistic psychology of 3 single and separate possible intellect for
all men. This is. however. 3 point on which Ulrich does not dwell at any length.
so that we are still unable to determine its ultimate place in his thought.

The philosophica] character οἱ Summa Dr Bono. IV. 1. confirms the con-
tention that Ulrich and his master St. Albert. while frequently appealing to
the authority of the Stagirite. actually espoused philosophical positions which
are more neo-platonic than Aristotelian, Their real authorities, in spite of their
many citations from Aristotle, are the anonymous Liber Dc causis. which, as
Thomas Aquinas proved conclusively. is a digest of the Elementan'o Theoloyica
of Proclusv the De Divinis Nominibus of the Pseudo-Areopagite, and the Meta-
plrysics of Avicenna. All the distinctive neo-platonio themes are here present:
the First Principle is the neccsse csse and actualized finite beings are the esse
in effecum the First Cause is the Fon! and Form of all created beings, con·
stantly saving thern from annihilation because of His infinite goodness; from
the primns jons flow all the emanations and hierarchical processions; human
knowledge is described in terms οἱ light similes, and illumination by the uni-
versally Agent Intellect is absolutely necessary for truth and knowing.

Summa De Bono IV. 1. is one more textual witness to the preponderant
influence of Albert on Ulrich. The disciple codified the master. but the Avicen-
nian and Pseudo-Dionysiam current οἱ thought. which so characterizes Albert,
is the inspiration of Ulrich.
