THESIS

The Theory of the First Principle in the Summa de Bono of Ulrich of
Strasbourg: Philosophical Study and Text

( Abstract)

Ulrich of Strasbourg. a German Dominican. was a fellow student with
Thomas Aquinas under Albertus Magnus in Cologne from> 1248 to 1254. Between
1272 and 1277, he held the office ot* Provincial Prefect of the German Dominican
Province. At the termination of his administrative duties. he was sent to Paris
to read the Scntcnccs of Peter Lombard and died there suddenly the same
year. i.c., 1277.

Ulrich's only extant work. the Summo Dc Bono, is a vast monument of
German neo-platonism. which. except for the relatively short portions edited by
Daguillon and Fagin. still remains in manuscript form. At present. this huge
philosophico-theological treatise is being edited in its entirety by a group of
palaeographers working jointly in Germany. Canada. and the United Statcs. The
First Tractate ot' the Fourth Book. which forms a part of this thesis. is included
in the above project. The text has been established from photostatic copies of
five different manuscripts. viz.. Paris. St. Omer. Yatican. Louvain. and Vienna.
οἱ which the Paris manuscript (RN. 15900) has been chosen as basic.

Ulrich of Strasbourg. who has earned himself the title of “eleve prefer& ot*
his master Albert, is an important witness to the strong neo—platonism which.
as we are coming to know, characterized Albert's thought. The rnore we study
the master of Cologne in relation to the doctrine οἱ his disciple. Ulrich. the
less do we find a common philosophica! ground between Albert and Thomas
Aquinas. The Ductor Amyclicns included in his synthesis a rejection os the neo-
platonism 111 1115 master. and rather formulated a philosophy which has since
been called a Christian Aristotelianism. Ulrich. on the other hand, faithfully
continues the neo-platonic tradition of Albert.

After protesting his doctrinal loyalty to his nmyish'r, Ulrich modtls the
first two books of his Summa Dc Bono on the De Divinis Nominibus of the
Pseudo-Areopagite. a work whose neo-platonic character is universally recog-
nized. Partial analyses point very strongly to Albert's still untdited commentary
on this same work as L'lrich's most immediate source. The First Tractate οἱ
the Fourth Book looks to another bible ot* neo-platonism t'or its inspiration.
namely. the anonymous Libcr De Cansis. Ulrich's dapendence on the Albertinian
commentary on this work is incontestable. ln fact. L’lrich's text. Summa De
Bono. lv. 1. is a compact synthesis of a much lengthier discussion to be found
in Albert's Liber Dc· (famis Et Processu (unversitatis. This conclusion con-
firms the results reached by previous students ot* the Summa Dc Bono. We may
