say, in general, that the study of those texts of L'lrich which have so far been
edited points to Albert as the source and inspiration of Ulrich's doctrine.

Under the general title of the theory of the First Principle, Ulrich includes
in Summa De Bono, IV, 1, a veritable compendium of Avicennian. Proclean,
and Pseudo-Dionysian metaphysical doctrines. These are principally concerned
with the coming of the universe into existence and with the constitution of the
things within it. Basing his proof on the Aristotelian demonstration of the im-
possibility of an infinite regress from the stand-point of a four-told causality.
Ulrich arrives at the necessity and primacy of the First Principle. whom he
characterizes as the neccsse csse. Because the L'ncaused Cause is prime. He
must necessarily be t'ree and because He is 3 free agent, He must possess 3 will.
The Boethian distinction between the qnod cs! and csse applies only to finite
and composite beings. In the First Principle. they are identical⁴ In typical
Avicennian terminology, L'Irich further explains the actualization ot' finite and
contingent beings as an csse in effectu which has been reduced from its status
of pure possibility by the action ot‘ the First Principle.

The Necessary Being is further called. in nco-platonic fashion. the Fon! and
Form of all created beings, which pours into them their esse and form and
constantly saves them t'rom annihilationi because οἰ His infinite goodness. From
the ”dator formarum* as from a primary font ot' all formsv flows 3 cascade of
emanations and processions of all beings 111 the universe. lndeedv Ulrich
enumerates 3 ten-sold hierarchical division of the world, each level ot* which
represents a progressively inferior being in direct proportion to its distance
from the First Principle and its greater dependence on matter.

Ulrich reserves for the First Principle the title of the universally Agent
Intellect, which. even as the sun diffusing its rays of light. imparts intelligibility
to all finite beings. The lesser created agent intellects are incapable of knowledge
in any independent way. They can know only in virtue of the illumination
which they receive from the First Intellect. This is so true that if the all-
pervasive light ot* the universally Agent Intellect were withdrawn for even a
moment, the world would be plunged into an intellectnal darkness comparable to
that caused by a total eclipse οἱ the. sun. Human knowledge. which is but an
inferior participation in the light of the First Intellect. affords 115 only partial
and intermittent glimpses of the eternal verities which arc weakly reflected in
enmattered objects. The universally Agent Intellect alone knows all things
causally‚ completely. and in the simultaneity uf an eternal ''now'' that transcends
all time.

However decisive the Avicennian influence might have been in the formation
of Ulrich's metaphysica] and psychological theories. 1115 treatise on the beginning
of time and the world represents 3 clear-cut separation from the Arabiam
philosopher. Following the example set down by William of Auvergne in his
De Universa, L'lrich vindicates the creative act as belonging exclusively to the
First Principle. whereas the Avicennian God was only one among a number
οἱ lesser intelligences who pretended to be creators and was further demeaned
because his creative activity was limited to only one effect. the Christian God
in Ulrich's cosmogony occupies His proper place as the sole author of all
reality. .
